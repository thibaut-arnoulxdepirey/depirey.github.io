# Teaching

During my PhD thesis I was hired as a teaching assistant in the “Frontières du Vivant” bachelor program of the Université Paris Cité. The topics covered were Newtonian
mechanics, thermodynamics, geometrical optics and electronics. After two years, I was given the opportunity to be in charge of the Newtonian mechanics lecture course.

I have also worked as an oral examiner in mathematics and physics at first and second year level of preparatory class (equivalent to first and second year of bachelor in mathematics and physics) at Lycée Louis-le-Grand, Paris, France.
