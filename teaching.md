# Teaching

From 2018 to 2021 I worked as a teaching assistant in the “Frontières du Vivant” bachelor program of the Université Paris Cité. The topics covered were Newtonian
mechanics, thermodynamics, geometrical optics and electronics. In the fall 2021, I was given the opportunity to be the main lecturer of the Newtonian mechanics course.

I have also worked as an oral examiner in mathematics and physics at first and second year level of preparatory class (equivalent to first and second year of bachelor in mathematics and physics) at Lycée Louis-le-Grand, Paris, France.
