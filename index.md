Hello, my name is Thibaut Arnoulx de Pirey. I am a physicist working on the statistical mechanics of nonequilibrium and disordered systems and eager to explore their connexion to biology and ecology. I am currently a CV Raman Postdoctoral Fellow of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore where I collaborate with [Sriram Ramaswamy](https://physics.iisc.ac.in/~sriram/) and [Vishwesha Guttal](https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/). 

Prior to that, I did a postdoc at the Technion working with [Guy Bunin](https://phsites.technion.ac.il/bunin/) and [Yariv Kafri](https://phsites.technion.ac.il/kafri/). Before joining there, I did my PhD at the Université Paris Cité under the supervision of [Frédéric van Wijland](https://sites.google.com/site/fvanwijland/home). The manuscript of my thesis can be found [here](https://thibaut-arnoulxdepirey.github.io/these_arnoulxdepirey.pdf). 

For more information, please have a look at my CV which you can find in English [here](https://thibaut-arnoulxdepirey.github.io/CV_english.pdf) and in French [here](https://thibaut-arnoulxdepirey.github.io/CV_french.pdf). You can also access my [publication list](./publications.md).

# Teaching

From 2018 to 2021, I worked as a teaching assistant in the “Frontières du Vivant” bachelor program of the Université Paris Cité. The topics covered were Newtonian
mechanics, thermodynamics, geometrical optics and electronics. In the fall 2021, I was main lecturer of the Newtonian mechanics course.
